      `With its' mild weather and sunshine almost all year-round, sprawling beaches and exquisite coral reefs, Hurghada is one of the most outstanding tourist cities in Egypt and a major tourist hub for domestic and foreign tourists alike. Its' natural islands make up a virgin environment for a variety of rare flora and fauna, offering a perfect setting for enjoying recreational sports such as land hunting and fishing.`,
      `Once just a lay-by for fishermen and now a burgeoning resort town, Hurghada is cuddled between the Sahara and the Red Sea. Plucked from limbo and pushed into the limelight, it's an aquatic wonderland for sailors, divers, sunbathers, and desert dwellers. With historic districts, traditi onal markets, renowned diving centres, and desert safaris, the town has emerged as an ideal destination for underwater adventures.`,
      `Today, it is a busy, sprawling town divided into three main areas, the Old Town (al Dahar) to the north, Saqala, the city centre to the south and the modern Marina with its' waterside cafes and restaurants. El Dahar is where the town's largest bazaar, the post office and the long-distance bus station are located.`

    textSubTitle: [
      `With pleasant weather and warm waters, Hurghada is a year-round destination. In summers, Egyptians – from Cairo and Luxor – flock here to escape the heat. The best time to travel in Hurghada is from April to June and September to November. During these periods, vacationers can expect warm sunny weather that is tolerable. We recommend desert safaris into the sandy terrains where you can learn the exotic traditions of the Bedouin people. They also usually include a BBQ dinner, camel rides across biblical plains and a memorable stargazing experience. `,
      `Day trips to Sahl Hasheesh, Makadi Bay, Safaga, and El Gouna, the nearby touristic resorts with diving spots and private golf courses. Alternatively, you can take boat tours to offshore islands like Sheduan Island, Orange Bay Island, and Abu Ramada Island.`
